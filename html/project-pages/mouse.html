        <h1>Ergonomic Mouse Design</h1>
        <h2>December 2024 to Present</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very intrigued by the idea of Logitec's vertical mouse, but have heard
            mixed reviews. I want to create my own vertical or ergonomic mouse that fits my hand. The goal is to iteratively
            work through designs, so I properly understand each step of my process. 
        </p>

        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using the youtber Player Conveyor's
            youtube video "I Built the World's Comfiest Mouse (ft. Bambu Lab A1)"
            as inspiration for my steps. I've started off by making a mock up mouse out of clay and getting a 3d model
            from a lidar sensor. The next step is to send it into blender and solidworks to clean up the design.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I am happy with the outer shape, I'll gut a cheap mouse to use it's circuit board for
            the first iteration of my mouse. Then, I will try to create a custom PCB for the mouse.
        </p>

        <h3>To Be Continued...</h3>
        <p>This is a Work In Progress (WIP). I'll update the website once I'm further along in the project!</p>
