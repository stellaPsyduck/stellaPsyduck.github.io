        <h1>Creating a Sequential Multiplier</h1>
        <h2>Winter 2025</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my labs in my Digital Systems I course (CIS*3120), we slowly created integrated circuits (ICs) in LogicWorks that would
            layer together to make a sequential multiplier. Here I'll go through the crucial ICs I created. I aim to add little about the course itself to respect the intellectual
            property of the professor. 
        </p>

        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using the youtber Player Conveyor's
            youtube video "I Built the World's Comfiest Mouse (ft. Bambu Lab A1)"
            as inspiration for my steps. I've started off by making a mock up mouse out of clay and getting a 3d model
            from a lidar sensor. The next step is to send it into blender and solidworks to clean up the design.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I am happy with the outer shape, I'll gut a cheap mouse to use it's circuit board for
            the first iteration of my mouse. Then, I will try to create a custom PCB for the mouse.

        <h3>To Be Continued...</h3>
        <p>This is a Work In Progress (WIP). I'll update the website once I'm further along in the project!</p>
