        <h1>Lil Gryphies</h1>
        <h2>January 2025 to Present</h2>

        <h3>What is a Lil Gryphie</h3>
        <p>A Lil Gryphie is a 3D-printed gotcha box or blind box toy I designed to fundraise for my robotics team. All the money made goes to financially supporting students in attending competition. I want the team to feel accessible to everyone, so fundraising and sponsorships are among our top priorities.
        </br></br>Alongside being excited about the successful fundraiser, I’ve been having a lot of fun optimizing our development, toy creation, and packaging processes.</p>

        <h3>Original Idea</h3>
        <p>My friend was unboxing a Smiski toy, and I didn’t understand the appeal. When I asked her what she liked about it, she said the mystery and the cuteness together made the toy fun to buy. I’m not sure if this reveals too much about my personality, but my first thought was to try to fundraise for robotics with that idea. 

        </br></br>That evening, I came up with the designs below and brought them up at the next executive meeting.

        <h3>The Toy Development</h3>
        <p>The executive team loved the idea, so one of my mechanical leads (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-gomes-4647b0306/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank">Jacob Gomes</a>) and his artist friend, who uses Blender (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-lee-marshall/" target="_blank">Hunter Marshall</a>), got to work. 

        </br></br>Jacob and I went back and forth with Hunter, choosing a design that was artistically what we envisioned, while also realistic for 3D printing.

        </div>
        <p>Now that we’ve gone through this process once, the design phase can go much more quickly. We plan to continue creating new designs from time to time, so it can serve as a continuous fundraising method.

        <h3>The Packaging</h3>
         <p> A huge part of Simiski, and other blind boxes, is the packaging. I wanted something affordable, but still exciting to unwrap. My original plan was to make something similar to a cigar box, with the UGRT logo on the top. The strip, designed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodney-maala-291097239/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank">Rodney Maala</a>, covering the opening gives the feeling of opening a secure box. However, the design looked so clean without the logo, so we decided to just leave it with only the strip.</p>

        </div>
        <p></br></br>Our original boxes were recycled boxes from packages we had ordered, but we realized we didn’t have enough recycled boxes for our sales. So, we designed a box to cut out of cardstock using the Bambu Lab’s H2D cutter. </p>
         
        <img src="images/lilgryphie/boxcut.jpg"  height="300px">
        <p></br></br>The actual protective paper is all recycled from digi-key orders our team gets, as there is always a plethora of paper protecting our electronics. 
         </br></br>The final step to perfecting the packaging process, which we are working on right now, is turning the strip into washi tape. Currently, we hand-glue every strip on the boxes, which bottlenecks our packing efficiency.</p>
