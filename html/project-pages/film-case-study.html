        <h1>No Money - Film Case Study</h1>
        <h2>January 2020</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short was created for a class assignment that asked us to do a case study on a director.
             I chose Tarintino and, more specifically, studied his hand-held camera motion and colours used
            in the last scene of "Inglorious Bastards."  I tried to emulate the dichotomy of nonchalant characters
            and stressed characters, having the non-English speakers stressed like in Tarintino's film.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was made a few years ago now, so looking at it I can see
            that my videography skills were a bit rough and my audio editing was not amazing. However,
            I still appreciate the process I went through. Planning and researching for the film forced me
            to look at some of my favourite movies differently and I got to film with my family and friends.
            I hope I get to work on more projects like this in the future.
