        <h1>No Money - Film Case Study</h1>
        <h2>January 2020</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short was created for a class assignment that asked us to do a case study on a director.
             I chose Tarantino and, more specifically, studied his hand-held camera motion and the colours used. In the last scene of "Inglorious Bastards."
               I tried to emulate the dichotomy of nonchalant and stressed characters as in Tarantino's film.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was made a few years ago, so looking back,
             I can see that my videography skills were a bit rough,
              and my audio editing wasn't amazing. However, I still appreciate
               the process I went through. I hope I get to work on more projects like this in the future.
