        <h1>Task Allocator</h1>
        <h2>Summer 2025</h2>

        <h3>Project Goal</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop a program that helps a group of people allocate tasks based on individuals’ willingness to perform specific tasks and the importance of the task. I aim to apply this to two
            situations. The first is a house cleaning scenario, where roommates can divide up their weekly chores based on preference, ensuring that every task gets completed at least every two weeks. The second scenario is inspired by task organization on the robotics team. It sets up a more complex scenario because it involves more conditionals. This task allocator must divide tasks based on preference, skill, number of people required for each task, and time people have available. The first scenario
            should solely be able to use maximum flow algorithms. However, the extra constraints in the second scenario
            make it more easily solved with a linear programming approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 1 - House Chores</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem can be represented as a network graph, shown in Figure 1a. This will allow us to use a
            maximum-flow algorithm to divide up the tasks. To ensure that I can use a network flow algorithm, I’ve added in
            total sources and sinks, shown in Figure 1b.

        <h3>To Be Continued...</h3>
        <p>This is a Work In Progress (WIP). I'll update the website once I'm further along in the project!</p>
