        <h1>Humanities Papers</h1>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy writing a research paper and become quite passionate about
            the ones I am assigned for classes. I thought I'd share some of my best works here for anyone who might be interested.
        </p>

        <h3>Fall 2022 - Political Science</h3>
        <h4>Politics of Aid and Development - POLS*3320</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the final paper of the class and we were asked to write a paper on any foreign aid relationship. Out of all the hummanities courses I've taken,
            this felt the most technical by far. Upon re-reading this paper, I am happy with how it turned out, but I think I would've re-worded some areas and tried to make aspects of it less personal.
        </p>

        <h3>Fall 2023 - Problem of Future Contingents</h3>
        <h4>Medieval Philosphy - POLS*3320</h4>
