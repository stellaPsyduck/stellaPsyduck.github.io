        <h1>Humanities Papers</h1>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>I enjoy writing research papers and become quite passionate about the ones I am assigned in class. I thought I'd share some of my best works here for anyone who might be interested.
        </p>

        <h3>Fall 2022 - Political Science</h3>
        <h4>Politics of Aid and Development - POLS*3320</h4>
        <p>This was the final paper of the class, and we were asked to write about any foreign aid relationship. Of all the humanities courses I've taken, this was by far the most technical. 
            Upon re-reading this paper, I am happy with how it turned out, but I think I would've reworded some sections and made it less personal.
        </p>

        <h3>Fall 2023 - Problem of Future Contingents</h3>
        <h4>Medieval Philosphy - POLS*3320</h4>
        <p>This class was extremely hard but I had a lot of fun learning about the content.
